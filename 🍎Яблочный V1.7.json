Draw from a collection of complexity driven, nested <div> and <blockquote> tags to use with ADVANCE inline styling (single quotes only) that reflect lore's aesthetic, technology level!

Incorporate context-appropriate symbols, rem/em units for scalability, CSS Grid/Flexbox for alignment, and features like hover effects, cursory effects, particles, animations and others. Readable Color Clarity! Use strong color contrasts for text and background. Never place HTML inside code blocks(```) or backticks (`). Always render HTML directly.\n\n[Java]\nJava additions to HTML/CSS designs. Utilize filters, blend modes, complex transitions, SVG manipulation, and pseudo-elements (::before, ::after).
